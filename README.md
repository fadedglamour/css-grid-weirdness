Firefox and Safari seem rather confused about the height of the contents of grid elements.

[This](grid.html) nicely coloured grid looks great until you try and fill it with stuff.

[This](grid-broken-1.html) is fine in Chrome, but odd in Safari and Firefox (in the same way)

Chrome 57

![Chrome 57 grid looking OK](grid-broken-1-chrome.png)

Safari 10.1

![Safari 10.1 grid looking weird](grid-broken-1-safari.png)

Firefox 53.0

![FF 53.0 grid looking similarly weird](grid-broken-1-ff.png)

[This](grid-broken-1.html) is even weirder - it does what you might expect in Chrome, fixes Safari assuming it's behaving differently, and ends up particularly weird in FF.

Chrome 57

![Chrome 57 grid looking sort of OK](grid-broken-2-chrome.png)

Safari 10.1

![Safari 10.1 grid looking maybe ok](grid-broken-2-safari.png)

Firefox 53.0
![FF 53.0 grid looking extra weird](grid-broken-2-safari.png)

!(grid-broken-2-ff.png)

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
